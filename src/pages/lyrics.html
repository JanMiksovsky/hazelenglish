    driven by fantasy<br />how do i get back to it once again<br />but the dream
    is all i have
  </p>
  <p>
    i try to recreate the image<br />in my head it’s all i see<br />but the
    flaws are all thats left
  </p>
  <p>
    all our lives<br />we just keep searching<br />for what does not exist<br />when
    will i<br />be willing to finally admit<br />it’s not real
  </p>
  <p>
    it’s tempting to predict<br />the future but it’s futile all the same<br />the
    past is all we have
  </p>
  <p>
    and every time i try to<br />replicate the signals in my brain<br />the
    flaws are all thats left
  </p>
  <p>
    all our lives<br />we just keep searching<br />for what does not exist<br />when
    will i<br />be willing to finally admit<br />it’s not real
